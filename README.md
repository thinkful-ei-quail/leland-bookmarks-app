# leland-bookmarks-app

Welcome to my bookmark app project!
Hosted Live @ https://thinkful-ei-quail.github.io/leland-bookmarks-app/

With this app users may add bookmarks that contain a title/name, url link, description, and give the bookmarks a star rating(1-5). Users can see their bookmarks once added, and it will show in a condensed view initially, displaying only the title and star-rating, but when the title is clicked upon users may then see the detailed view allowing them to read the bookmark's description, visit the site, delete the bookmark, or collapse the view back to condensed.  Users will also receive appropriate feedback in the form of prompt messages when attempting to submit a blank field, or an error message if the format for the field is not valid along with instructions on how it must be corrected. Users can also filter the list of bookmarks by way of their star-rating eliminating bookmarks from view that do not have at least the number of stars the user selects. 


This project utilized AJAX, jQuery, HTML/CSS, NPM and Webpack. 


Thank you!
